\description{
Genomes to fields (G2F) is a multi-institutional, public collaborative to develop information and tools that support the
translation of maize (Zea mays L.) genomic information into relevant phenotypes for the benefit of growers, consumers,
and society. Building on existing maize genome sequence resources, the project focuses on developing approaches to improve phenomic predictability and facilitate
the development and deployment of tools and resources that help address fundamental problems of sustainable agricultural productivity.
Specific projects within G2F involve collaboration from research fields such as genetics, genomics, plant physiology, agronomy, climatology and crop modeling,
computational sciences, statistics, and engineering. See https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-020-4922-8.

Here we used the geographic coordinates from 93 environments (diverse locations across 4 years)
