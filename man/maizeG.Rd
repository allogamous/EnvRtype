\description{
This data set was included in Souza et al. (2017) and Cuevas et al (2019) is from
the Helix Seeds Company (HEL).  Genotyping Array of 616 K SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism)
(Unterseer et al. 2014). Standard quality controls (QC) were applied to
the data, removing markers with a Call Rate $ 0.95. The remaining
missing data in the lines were imputed with the Synbreed package
(Wimmer et al. 2015) using the algorithms from the Beagle 4.0
software (Browning and Browning 2009). Markers with Minor
Allele Frequency (MAF) of # 0.05 were removed. After applying
QC, 52,811 SNPs were available to make the predictions. The phenotypic and genomic data of inbred lines are credited to Helix Seeds
Ltda. Company.
